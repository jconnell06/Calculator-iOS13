# Calculator-iOS13
Do math quickly with this iOS app.

This app was created as a part of a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WsWAEMScldUQn8F/) I am taking (May 2020). 

The goal: create a basic calculator. While the final product isn't revolutionary (you do, after all, get a default calculator app on your iPhone), the purpose of this module was to focus on the trade-offs between structs and classes, and using internal/external params and Swift access levels to support data integrity within the app.

## Lesson Objectives
* Learn to work with Swift Structures
* Understand Structs vs. Classes
* Understand Internal/External Parameters
* Understand Swift Access Levels
* Learn about Tuples
